# auction-system

Implementation of an auction system. The system presents competition management and notifies bidders when the bidding deadline is approaching.
You can insert objects into the auction and bid for a specific auction.
The entire system was developed with the aim of maximizing its efficiency in terms of both processing time and competition control. Semaphores were used to optimize the control of the competition.
